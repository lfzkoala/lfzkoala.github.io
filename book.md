If you want to chat, book a time that works for you.

### Quick chat (Calendly)

Book here:

- **Calendly:** <https://calendly.com/daniel-linfeng-zhou/quick-chat-1>

If the link doesn’t open for any reason, you can also email me:

- **Email:** [{{ site.social-network-links.email | default: "email me" }}](mailto:{{ site.social-network-links.email }})

### Optional: paid consults
If you want to charge for calls, the simplest static-friendly setup is:

1. Create a **Stripe Payment Link** for “30-min consult” / “60-min consult”
2. Put that Payment Link on this page (or make it the primary CTA)
3. After payment, redirect users to your Calendly/Cal.com booking page

Tell me which booking tool and whether you want paid calls, and I’ll update this page with the real links + wording.
