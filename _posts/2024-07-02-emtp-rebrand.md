We are excited to announce our rebranding from XMTP Labs to Ephemera. This name change underscores that Ephemera, the company, is distinct and separate from XMTP, the protocol. The name also reinforces that Ephemera's core role in nurturing XMTP is not meant to be permanent. In fact, the true marker of Ephemera's success is a future in which it can step away and have XMTP endure as a decentralized, secure, private, and resilient protocol, maintained by a committed and diverse community of contributors and participants. More details see the [announcement](https://paragraph.xyz/@ephemera/gm-ephemera).
