We have noticed that the ETH Spot ETF approval triggered a short-term bull market but recently the market cooled down again. Except some meme coins rebounding a bit, most of cryptocurrencies are still in the local bottom. What's worse, some meme coins rugged these days. Notably $normie and $boge on the base chain.

Even though both of them are based, the rug still happened. In general, this is not a good signal.
