Thanks for Cursor, recently I built three AI agents as my new employees and they worked very well.

## Trading Alert Agent
An AI-powered cryptocurrency trading agent that uses technical analysis to make trading decisions. Some features include

- Real-time cryptocurrency price monitoring
- Technical analysis using multiple indicators:
  - RSI (Relative Strength Index)
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
  - Bollinger Bands
- Automated trading execution
- Error handling and logging

After adding my own trading strategies, it is able to make profits and notify me with signals found by the agent.
