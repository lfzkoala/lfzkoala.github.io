We are thrilled to [announce](https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/107795/SPAC-Columbus-Acquisition-files-for-a-$58-million-IPO) a significant milestone in Columbus Acquisition Corp's journey toward becoming a publicly traded company. On November 15, 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially accepted our complete IPO filing package, marking a pivotal step toward our anticipated listing on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. This is another SPAC filed by our capital (Hercules and Pepper) and previously we have filed another two $50+ million SPAC IPOs.
