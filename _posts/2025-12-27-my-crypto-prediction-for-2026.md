### predictions for 2026 (grouped by theme)

#### Markets & price action

- **BTC probably makes a new ATH in 2026, but the path is “grindy”**: I expect a bounce after several weeks based on the weekly chart, and that bounce likely tags a new ATH. After that, over a longer horizon (several months), I expect BTC to trade materially lower at range **$50k–$60k**, and in a worse scenario **$40k–$50k**. Fewer straight-line manias, more range trading and quiet institutional absorption.
- **SOL likely rhymes with BTC (weekly bounce, monthly drawdown), but with bigger downside**: I expect Solana to bounce on the weekly timeframe and then draw down on the monthly timeframe. Compared to BTC, SOL likely sees a larger drawdown.
- **I’m more bullish on ETH than BTC and SOL**: on the charts, ETH looks bullish on both the weekly and monthly timeframes. That said, ETH tends to carry higher volatility and more leverage, so the path higher will likely be even more “grindy” than BTC. It could dip lower first, then push higher.
- **No more broad “alts go up together” season (and what I’d focus on instead)**: I don’t expect a classic, across-the-board alt season where everything pumps. Altcoin performance should become more selective and more tied to real fundamentals and execution. The “farm-and-dump” coins will likely either never recover or keep bleeding after listings—there are simply too many alts and limited liquidity. If anything works, I’d focus on projects that can bridge Web2 and Web3 and connect real-world rails to onchain rails—**RWA**, **tokenization**, **stablecoins**, **DeFi**, and related infrastructure. Because such projects are able to drive money from traditional finance. **Privacy** is also a theme worth watching. **Quantum computing** is another direction to track, but I’m not convinced it becomes a catalyst in 2026.

- **BTC volatility keeps compressing and looks more macro-like**: a broader holder base + more passive and regulated flows = fewer extreme candles.
- **The “4-year cycle” keeps weakening**: the halving still matters, but its marginal impact fades; rates and liquidity matter more.

#### Institutions, regulation, and distribution

- **The U.S. enters an “ETF expansion” era**: beyond BTC/ETH, more index, thematic, and yield-wrapped products become easy to buy.
- **Market-structure clarity becomes a top catalyst**: once rules are clearer, banks/brokers/wealth platforms can distribute at scale.
- **Flows beat vibes (at least in windows)**: net demand through regulated rails can outpace new supply, and pricing gets driven by flows more than retail mood.

#### Infrastructure + corporatization (M&A, full-stack)

- **M&A stays hot and “full-stack platforms” consolidate share**: trading, custody, lending, settlement, compliance, and data get integrated into a smaller set of winners.
- **Crypto equities improve on a relative basis**: clearer rules + broader product lines + consolidation improve business quality (more fintech/market-infra-like).

#### Stablecoins & payments

- **Stablecoins become a default rail for cross-border B2B settlement—and also get a political “blame moment”**: an EM FX/capital-flow episode puts them in headlines and accelerates the push toward compliance.

#### Onchain apps (DeFi, prediction markets, AI)

- **“Productization” beats protocol worship**: vaults/strategies/structured products (“ETFs 2.0”) grow AUM; prediction markets go more mainstream; AI agents become a real new source of transactions and payments.



### My framework (why 2026 could feel different)

In 2026, I think the “crypto story” shifts further from narratives to plumbing: access, distribution, regulation, and balance sheets.

- **Distribution flips from “crypto-native” to “portfolio-native”**: ETFs and other regulated wrappers make allocation feel normal, not niche.
- **Regulation becomes a growth lever (not just a risk)**: clearer rules push activity into compliant rails, which is exactly where banks/fintechs can participate.
- **Balance sheets matter more than influencers**: corporates, endowments, and public companies move slowly—but when they move, flows are sticky and size is real.
- **Apps mature into businesses**: more revenue, more M&A, more full-stack products (custody, lending, trading, payments) built for institutions and enterprises.

### What would change my mind

- **Policy stalls or reverses**: if market-structure legislation fails (or enforcement ramps), the “regulated distribution” arc slows down.
- **A liquidity shock**: if macro tightens or credit breaks, risk assets (including crypto) can stay heavy even with great fundamentals.
- **Stablecoin backlash accelerates**: one high-profile incident (sanctions, banking stress, EM FX crisis scapegoating) can change timelines fast.
- **Security/regime risks**: major protocol, custody, or governance failures could reset trust for a cycle.

### Closing

My bet is that 2026 is less about a single “narrative” and more about compounding adoption through regulated distribution, stablecoin settlement, and tokenized balance sheets—while AI adds a new class of native crypto users (agents).
