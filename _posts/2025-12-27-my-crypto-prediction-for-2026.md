### predictions for 2026 (grouped by theme)

#### Markets & price action

- **BTC probably makes a new ATH in 2026, but the path is “grindy”**: fewer straight-line manias, more range trading and quiet institutional absorption.
- **Near-term bounce → new ATH, then a multi-month drawdown**: I expect a bounce after several weeks based on the weekly chart, and that bounce likely tags a new ATH. After that, over a longer horizon (several months), I expect BTC to trade materially lower—base-case range **$50k–$60k**, and in a worse scenario **$40k–$50k**.

- **BTC volatility keeps compressing and looks more macro-like**: a broader holder base + more passive/regulated flows = fewer extreme candles.
- **The “4-year cycle” keeps weakening**: the halving still matters, but its marginal impact fades; rates and liquidity matter more.

#### Institutions, regulation, and distribution

- **The U.S. enters an “ETF expansion” era**: beyond BTC/ETH, more index, thematic, and yield-wrapped products become easy to buy.
- **Market-structure clarity becomes a top catalyst**: once rules are clearer, banks/brokers/wealth platforms can distribute at scale.
- **Flows beat vibes (at least in windows)**: net demand through regulated rails can outpace new supply, and pricing gets driven by flows more than retail mood.

#### Infrastructure + corporatization (M&A, full-stack)

- **M&A stays hot and “full-stack platforms” consolidate share**: trading, custody, lending, settlement, compliance, and data get integrated into a smaller set of winners.
- **Crypto equities improve on a relative basis**: clearer rules + broader product lines + consolidation improve business quality (more fintech/market-infra-like).

#### Stablecoins & payments

- **Stablecoins become a default rail for cross-border B2B settlement—and also get a political “blame moment”**: an EM FX/capital-flow episode puts them in headlines and accelerates the push toward compliance.

#### Onchain apps (DeFi, prediction markets, AI)

- **“Productization” beats protocol worship**: vaults/strategies/structured products (“ETFs 2.0”) grow AUM; prediction markets go more mainstream; AI agents become a real new source of transactions and payments.



### My framework (why 2026 could feel different)

In 2026, I think the “crypto story” shifts further from narratives to plumbing: access, distribution, regulation, and balance sheets.

- **Distribution flips from “crypto-native” to “portfolio-native”**: ETFs and other regulated wrappers make allocation feel normal, not niche.
- **Regulation becomes a growth lever (not just a risk)**: clearer rules push activity into compliant rails, which is exactly where banks/fintechs can participate.
- **Balance sheets matter more than influencers**: corporates, endowments, and public companies move slowly—but when they move, flows are sticky and size is real.
- **Apps mature into businesses**: more revenue, more M&A, more full-stack products (custody, lending, trading, payments) built for institutions and enterprises.

### What would change my mind

- **Policy stalls or reverses**: if market-structure legislation fails (or enforcement ramps), the “regulated distribution” arc slows down.
- **A liquidity shock**: if macro tightens or credit breaks, risk assets (including crypto) can stay heavy even with great fundamentals.
- **Stablecoin backlash accelerates**: one high-profile incident (sanctions, banking stress, EM FX crisis scapegoating) can change timelines fast.
- **Security/regime risks**: major protocol, custody, or governance failures could reset trust for a cycle.

### Closing

My bet is that 2026 is less about a single “narrative” and more about compounding adoption through regulated distribution, stablecoin settlement, and tokenized balance sheets—while AI adds a new class of native crypto users (agents).
