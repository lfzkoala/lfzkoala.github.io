### Angel Investing
I wrote my first investment check in 2014 and I'm happy to invest in innovative ideas. Since I'm a cryptographer, I'm extremely excited to talk about new ideas based on cryptography or cryptographer founders. Additionally, if you have worked with me in industry (e.g., Coinbase, Hyperledger, Google .etc) or someone else who has worked with me referred you, then I'm open to chatting. If you'd like to pitch with me for angel investing, please send your email to [daniel.linfeng.zhou@gmail.com](daniel.linfeng.zhou@gmail.com).
