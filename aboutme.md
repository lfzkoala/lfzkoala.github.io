title: About me

Hey there! I'm Linfeng (Daniel). I started my career as a cryptographer and now building and investing in crypto, AI and quantum/post-quantum computing. 

Right now I'm building something new in crypto. 

I'm investing in crypto via angel investing, [Pepper Ventures](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pepper-ventures-vc) as a founding partner and other firms where I'm a limited partner. 

I'm also advising crypto startups and investing firms via [Fertile Fields Labs](https://sites.google.com/view/fertilefieldslabs/home) that I founded. Recently too many people asked me about stablecoins, I'm too tired to be sick.
