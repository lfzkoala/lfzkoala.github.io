Hey there! I'm Linfeng (Daniel). I started my career as a cryptographer and now building and investing in crypto, AI and quantum/post-quantum computing. 

Right now I'm building something new in crypto. I'm investing in crypto via angel investing, [Pepper Ventures](https://sites.google.com/view/pepperventures) as a founding partner and other firms where I'm a limited partner. I'm also advising crypto startups and investing firms via [Fertile Fields Labs](https://sites.google.com/view/fertilefieldslabs/home) that I founded.

Previously:

* Worked as Principal Cryptographer at [Ephemera](https://ephemerahq.com/) building secure decentralized messaging protocol.

* Designed confidential blockchain networks for financial services, enhancing privacy and security in the financial sector for [State Street](https://www.statestreet.com/ca/en/asset-owner). 
* I've pursued academic research in cryptography, focusing on blockchain proof-of-stake consensus and zero-knowledge proofs and then dropped out PhD.
* I was one of founding team members of [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric), helping to shape the foundation of enterprise blockchain solutions.
