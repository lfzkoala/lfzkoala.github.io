title: About me
---

I'm building something new web3 infrastructure for web2 adoption, especially in real-world assets and AI. 

In general, I'm a cryptographer and investor in crypto, AI and quantum/post-quantum computing. 

I'm also privately advising asset management firms via [Fertile Fields Labs](https://fertilefieldslabs.xyz/).
