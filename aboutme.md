My name is Linfeng (Daniel) Zhou. I'm a cryptographer and also an investor. 

I'm currently the Principal Cryptographer at [XMTP Labs](https://xmtp.org/). I also founded [Fertile Fields Labs](https://sites.google.com/view/fertilefieldslabs/home), a crypto consulting firm for security auditing and business advising. Before that, I was co-leading the cryptography team at Coinbase and then engineering lead for Coinbase Wallet. I also worked for Transparent Financial Systems, State Street, IBM Research, Cheetah Mobile and Google. For more details, please check my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniellinfeng/)

I co-founded [Pepper Ventures](https://sites.google.com/view/pepperventures) with my fantastic partners in late 2022 to invest in crypto/web3 and help companies go public with IPO and SPAC Mergers. Our crypto/web3 investment check size is usually from $50K to $250K. We already filed two SPAC IPOs and have another two in progress. 

I'm also a limited partner of some venture capital firms and also doing angel investing in crypto/web3.
