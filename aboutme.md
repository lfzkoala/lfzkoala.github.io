Hey there! I'm Linfeng (Daniel). Right now I'm building something new web3 infrastructure for web2 adoption, especially in real-world assets and AI. 

In general, I'm a cryptographer and investor in crypto, AI and quantum/post-quantum computing. 

I'm advising crypto startups and asset management firms via [Fertile Fields Labs](https://sites.google.com/view/fertilefieldslabs/home) that I founded when some narratives come up. 

Read [my experience with crypto](https://medium.com/@daniel.linfeng.zhou/written-on-the-occasion-of-bitcoins-fourth-halving-452605a874da) if you're interested.
